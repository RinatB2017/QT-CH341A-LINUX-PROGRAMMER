# QT-CH341A-LINUX-PROGRAMMER
The programmer tools use the EEPROM CH341A programmer for the 24C01 ... 24C1024 chip.
This program uses QhexEditor (autor: Qingfeng Xia) from https://github.com/qingfengxia/qhexedit
and ch341 c-programmer tools  (autor: Collin Allen) from https://github.com/command-tab/ch341eeprom

I have modified the GUI in QhexEditor. I added buttons to read from eeprom, save to eeprom and programmer information menu.
